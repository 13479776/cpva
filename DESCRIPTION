Description: CPVA is a interactive tool for visualization and annotation of 
    chromatographic peaks in non-targeted metabolomics data. CPVA unfolds the 
    hidden characteristics of chromatographic peaks of LC-MS data through 
    annotation of adducts, isotopes and contaminants, and visualization of 
    peak morphology metrics. The CPVA is a free, user-friendly tool to help 
    users to identify the potential noises and contaminants encountered in 
    chromatographic peak lists generated from non-targeted metabolomics data, 
    resulting in a decrease of false positive peak calling, thereby improving 
    the data quality of non-targeted metabolomics studies.
