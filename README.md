# CPVA

CPVA is a interactive web tool for visualization and annotation of chromatographic peaks in non-targeted metabolomics data. CPVA unfolds the hidden characteristics of chromatographic peaks of LC-MS data through annotation of adducts, isotopes and contaminants, and visualization of peak morphology metrics. The CPVA is a free, user-friendly tool to help users to identify the potential noises and contaminants encountered in chromatographic peak lists generated from non-targeted metabolomics data, resulting in a decrease of false positive peak calling, thereby improving the data quality of non-targeted metabolomics studies.
